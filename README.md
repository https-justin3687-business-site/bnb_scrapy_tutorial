# UPDATE 18-04-2018

Airbnb has changed a lot since I have written this tutorial and therefore this code will not work without major modifications.
Fortunately @bashedev has done a nice job to keep up with the changes and offers a working example.
You can find his awsome code herere: https://github.com/bashedev/airbnb_scraper
